# Fix for database error with long domain names (Issue #1519)
# 
# Problem: Django was crashing with database error when scanning domains with long names:
# django.db.utils.DataError: value too long for type character varying(100)
#
# Solution: Increase results_dir field length from 100 to 500 characters to prevent 
# varchar(100) overflow. This provides ample safety margin for the new path generation
# approach that uses domain IDs instead of domain names.
#
# Safe to run on production - only increases field capacity without data loss.
